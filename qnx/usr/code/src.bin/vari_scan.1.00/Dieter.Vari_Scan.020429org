Dear All.

Did you ever fret about the fact, that normal_scan changes with
almost each change of the ROS version; and that, as a consequence,
you have to modify all your radar control programs?

Does it cause you pain to develop double and triple convoluted
loops to accommodate complicated scan patterns?

If yes, then you may want to look at a little program, that I
developed and tested this month. It is called vari_scan and its
only argument is the name of a file with input parameters; so
the entry in the schedule file would look like this:

2002 04 01 00 00 vari_scan /data/rcp/normal_scan_di.rcp

As an example, if you wanted to run normal_scan in discretionary
time and forward scan, then the input file for vari_scan would
look like this:

# normal_scan_di.rcp

I hope that this example is clear enough to enable you to write your own ones.
vari_scan is not intended to replace normal_scan or fast_scan, but as a way
for fast and easy implementation of RCPs, that are maybe only used once or
twice during DT intervals.

The software can be downloaded vi anonymous ftp from radar.usask.ca,
subdirectory vari_scan.

Copy the tar file to /home/radar/usr/code/src.bin and untar.
cd to directory vari_scan and make.
The example file normal_scan_di.rcp is part of the tar file
and should be moved to a directory of your choice [I used /data/rcp ].
